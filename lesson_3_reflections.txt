When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when working on different computers or working with the other guys.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The local repository is like the base, it may be wrong in the online version. Pull changes manually makes the repository more stable.
